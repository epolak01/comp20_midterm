What does the business do and how does the website help them?
  One of the biggest struggles for plumbers is dealing with their wide network of clients that span long distances. Today, a 
  plumber would get a call to request for help, and can only determine the issue when they arrive at the clientâ€™s house. This 
  website seeks to ease the potential long distance a plumber must travel, and allows communication between plumber and client 
  in order to determine if a visit is necessary. Website is a platform to connect clients and plumbers so that plumbers can 
  figure out the problem without driving over, which maximizes efficiency. The website has an account system, so clients would 
  log in with a username.
  
Section of Code we are most proud of:

 <form class="modal-content animate" method="post">
    <div class="imgcontainer">
      <div onclick="document.getElementById('id01').style.display='none'" class="close" title="Close Modal">&times;</div>
      <img src="Plumber_Login.jpeg" alt="Avatar" class="avatar">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <label for="uname"><b>Username</b></label>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Username" name="uname" required>

      <label for="psw"><b>Password</b></label>
      <input type="password" placeholder="Enter Password" name="psw" required>
        
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </div>

    <div class="container" style="background-color:#f1f1f1">
      <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('id01').style.display='none'" class="cancelbtn">Cancel</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>


<button onclick="document.getElementById('pos').style.display='block'" style="width:auto;">Sign Up</button>

<div id="pos" class="pick">
	<a href="clientSignUp.html" class="refbutton">Customer Sign Up</a>
	<a href="plumberSignUp.html" class="refbutton">Plumber Sign Up</a>
	</style>
</div>
<div id="id02" class="modal">
  
  <form class="modal-content animate" method="post">
    <div class="imgcontainer">
      <div onclick="document.getElementById('id02').style.display='none'" class="close" title="Close Modal">&times;</div>
      <img src="Plumber_Login.jpeg" alt="Avatar" class="avatar">
    </div>

Why we picked this/How it works: It is something that we have not covered in class, so we thought it was cool that we could 
make such a complex pop-up as opposed to the regular alert(). This pop up works with a animate class that uses a zoom transition to open a login pop-up page. This is done by first assigning the form containing class "modal" to have "display: none;" which hides the div tag until the button to login changes the display to "block". Inside this form are two input tags asking for a username and password login, with a placeholder faded text. The login button should then send this login information out to authenticate the user. Also, there are two cancel buttons which is a 'X' written as "&times;" and "Cancel" which simply reset the div tag containing the login form to have "display: none;". This allows for a more seamless transitioning pop-up functionality.
